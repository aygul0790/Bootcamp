        "\n",
        "For a more natural interaction, we'll add conversation memory to allow multi-turn conversations. This is a crucial component of any practical agent system.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What is Conversation Memory?\n",
        "\n",
        "Conversation memory allows an agent to \"remember\" previous exchanges in a conversation, enabling it to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Maintain context**: Understand references to previously mentioned topics\n",
        "* **Follow conversation flow**: Create a more natural dialogue experience\n",
        "* **Handle follow-up questions**: Process questions like \"What about the pasta recipe?\" that rely on previous context\n",
        "* **Build upon previous responses**: Avoid repeating information already provided\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How It Works\n",
        "\n",
        "In our implementation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We create a simple list (`recipe_conversation`) that stores the entire conversation history\n",
        "2. Each user input and agent response is added to this list as it occurs\n",
        "3. When the user asks a new question, we send the entire conversation history as context\n",
        "4. The language model can then reference this history when determining how to respond\n",
        "\n",
        "Without conversation memory, each interaction would be treated as an isolated exchange, forcing users to provide complete context with every question. This would result in a rigid, unnatural experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "The example below demonstrates a simple conversation memory implementation using a list to track the entire conversation. In production systems, more sophisticated approaches might be used, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Summarizing long conversations to stay within token limits\n",
        "* Maintaining entity and state trackers\n",
        "* Using vector databases to store relevant conversation fragments\n",

        "   - We reuse the same LLM instance we created earlier\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **System Prompt Design**:\n",
        "   - The system prompt is specifically tailored for financial assistance\n",
        "   - It instructs the agent to retrieve stock information and perform calculations\n",
        "   - It includes a formatting instruction (rounding dollar values) for consistency\n",
        "   - This demonstrates how the system prompt shapes agent behavior for different use cases\n",

        "The power of this approach is that we can easily create specialized agents by:\n",
        "1. Selecting appropriate tools for the domain\n",

        "3. Using the same underlying LLM and workflow architecture\n",

        "3. **Ask about relationships**: The agent can compare stocks or metrics across companies\n",
        "4. **Start simple**: Begin with basic queries before asking complex multi-step questions\n",
        "5. **Use conversation memory**: For related follow-up questions, use the chat with memory function\n",
        "6. **Consider data freshness**: Stock prices and financial metrics change frequently, so results will vary\n",
