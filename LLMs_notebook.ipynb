The next\\nstep is to transform those functions into methods that make the relationships explicit.\\nCode examples from this chapter are available from https://thinkpython.com/code/\\nTime2.py, and solutions to the exercises are in https://thinkpython.com/code/Point2_\\nsoln.py.\\n17.1 Object-oriented features\\nPython is an object-oriented programming language , which means that it provides fea-\\ntures that support object-oriented programming, which has these deﬁning characteristics:\\n• Programs include class and method deﬁnitions.\\n• Most of the computation is expressed in terms of operations on objects.\\n• Objects often represent things in the real world, and methods often correspond to the\\nways things in the real world interact.\\nFor example, the Time class deﬁned in Chapter 16 corresponds to the way people record\\nthe time of day, and the functions we deﬁned correspond to the kinds of things people do\\nwith times. Similarly, the Point and Rectangle classes in Chapter 15 correspond to the\\nmathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle.\\nSo far, we have not taken advantage of the features Python provides to support object-\\noriented programming. These features are not strictly necessary; most of them provide\\nalternative syntax for things we have already done.
